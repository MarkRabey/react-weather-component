## Version 1.0.0 is coming! ðŸŽ‰

I've started initial work on version 1.0.0! Why v1? Because it will be a full re-write! The plan is to:

- port the code to TypeScript
- adding loads of styling options
- better documentation
- unit tests, and,
- eventually, I hope to add React Native support

## Version < 1.0.0

### IMPORTANT!

GitHub serves all GitHub Pages content via `https`, however, the OpenWeatherMap API does not currently function on `https`. Therefore, the demo pages aren't working correctly. I'm working to resolve this (possibly with another API provider).

To test outside of GitHub Pages, clone the repo, run `npm install && npm start` and visit http://localhost:8080.

### Install

```shell
npm install react-weather-component --save
```
